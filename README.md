# React i18next app built with ChatGPT

This app accompanies a [Phrase blog](https://phrase.com/blog/) tutorial.

- If you want to code along with the tutorial, grab the project from the `start` directory (`npm install` and `npm run dev` to get started).
- If you want the final project, it's in the `complete` directory (`npm install` and `npm run dev`).
- If you want to see the ChatGPT conversation that led to the completed project, navgiate to the `conversation` directory and run `npx serve .`
